## Intro

My brother is a daily user of [Drivy](https://www.drivy.com/), a french peer-to-peer car rental service.

He lists their 3 cars:

* Peugeot 306
* Range Rover Sport
* Porsche Boxter

Any person, call the `driver` can book a car for given dates/distance.

## Just tell me what to do

1. Fork the project via `github`
1. Clone the project `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/drivy`
1. Solve each exercises inside `index.js` file with JavaScript
1. Once the exercise is solved, commit something like `git ac "decrease pricing for longer rentals (exo 2)"`
1. 6 exercises, so 6 commits
1. Don't forget to push before 4 PM
1. Check your codebase by opening [/public/index.html](./public/index.html)
1. Check the ouput in your browser console

## Don't forget:

* DRY - Don't repeat yourself
* DOT - Do One Thing
* KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid
